<p>
    DR9 of the <a href="http://legacysurvey.org/decamls/">Legacy Surveys</a> will include about 120K
    <a href="http://legacysurvey.org/decamls/">DECaLs</a> exposures. The purpose of this page is build a
    relatively small (6K exposures) dataset labeled by experts that can be used to train a machine-learning model to automatically
    classify the whole data set.
</p>
<p>
    Click on a tab above to display thumbnails of downsampled DECaLs exposures (using the community pipeline output) for
    different bands. Click on the thumbnail corners to mark an exposure as either definitely bad ("&cross;") or else possibly bad ("?")
    and needing more investigation. Any exposures you view that are not labeled this way are assumed to be of sufficient quality for DR9.
    You can change your label as often as you like (although each labeling action is recorded).
